<h1>About this site</h1>

<p>This is a lightweight web app built with performant svelte components and scaffolded with the application framework
	Sapper. This gives us routing out of the box, along with SEO, SSR, code-splitting and many other features. For the
	video functionality, this app uses Twilio Video to create unique chat rooms that your friends can join. Useful if
	you family wants to see your face, or if you just need a quiet place to hang with your buds.</p>
